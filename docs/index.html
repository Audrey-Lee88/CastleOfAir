								<p> Music shouldn’t be just about listening. Elevate your music experience with the magic of Castle of Air. </p>
								<p> We are the creators of Castle of Air. Our name was originally Goblet of Water, but evolved over time as our project shifted through different <a href="#process">phases</a>.</p>
								<p> Our minimum viable product, or MVP, was to create an aesthetic music visualizer with at least two frequency channels that adjust the height of small foam balls. We wanted our MVP to have LEDs (lights) flashing according to the tempo and controlled by preloaded data from Spotify. The foam ball height is controlled by live analog audio input. We were able to build up from our MVP to create awesome demo day experience for users. Our final structure had 5 frequency channels incorporated into our clean, beautifully-designed 3D-printed castle structure. </p>
								<p> Our final product is an interactive music visualizer that utilizes foam balls, lights, and fans to simulate the feel and tempo of a song. </p>

									<li>10/17/19 <br> Today was the first day of writing our blog of our meetings, as well as our first organized meeting to start planning and fabricating for Sprint 1. We divvied up our tasks between the different subteams on our Trello board, and were able to get an idea of a first-cut prototype. For our Sprint 1 idea, we would use a medium of air and different colors of paper to visualize music. We decided to use POE supplied motors and a sheet of acrylic from the scrap bin for our testing purposes. With this first-cut model, we would be able to gauge what can be achieved for this project and how all sub-teams (electrical, mechanical, and software) will be integrated. The electrical section will sense audio input, mechanical will create the chambers for the fan and paper, and software will analyze the audio input and control the fan. <br> <span class="image fit"><img src="images/10_17_pic1.jpg" alt="" /></span>This is a sketch of our idea for the first-cut prototype.<br>-Audrey Lee </li>

									<li>10/18/19 <br> Today we hopped into initial research and design. We discussed scalability and feasibility with two NINJAs, and solidified our thought process on where the project was heading. During our check in with the teaching team, we talked about the difficulty of using water, but ended on an optimistic note. Our team just has to be careful not to get to engrossed in water control. The mechanical team launched into CAD and fabrication, the electrical team pushed into circuit diagrams for audio sensing, and the software team started work on interpreting the Spotify API and brainstormed how to interpret the external audio input. <br> <span class="image fit"><img src="images/10_18_pic1.jpg" alt="" /></span>

									</li>

									<li>10/20/2019 <br> Today we made progress in all the mechanical, electrical, and software for Sprint 1. All the mechanical components except the fan were assembled and put together. We struggled quite a bit with the fan, for it was not pushing the air upwards, but rather downwards and also sidewise. To mitigate this issue, we worked on changing the angle of the fan and started a reprint on the 3D printers. For the electrical side, we soldered together basic wiring composed of resistors and capacitors for the microphone sensor. The next step to this would be soldering the microphone sensor to what was done today. For the software side, we worked on learning how to use the “spotipy” library and played around retrieving data from songs, user’s playlists, etc. This was mostly research for the future sprints; therefore, the software goal for Sprint 1 is to control the speed of the fan (e.g. with tempo) and work with the electrical components. <br> <span class="image fit"><img src="images/10_20_pic1.jpg" alt="" /></span><br>

                                    <li>
                                        10/22/2019 <br> During today’s meeting, the team continued working hard to make mechanical, software, and electrical progress with the knowledge that our first sprint review is coming up soon on Friday. The things we need to accomplish in our next meeting and before our report-out is integrating the mechanical, software, and electrical parts and creating a presentation that communicates our work and future plans clearly. We received advice about Friday’s report from the POE instructors that we will be sure to utilize to planning for our presentation. The software team is currently tackling the issue of getting multiple access tokens for the song playing and the features of the song playing. Currently, separate requests must be made to access the song’s data, but the team is trying to figure out how to not have to pull up another website to make each request. The software team also began trying to communicate between Arduino and Python. <br> For the electrical component, we got microphone audio input, but the voltage difference isn’t high enough so we are doing lots of circuit building on our breadboard to amplify the signal.
                                        The mechanical team started today’s meeting working with version 2 of the 3D printed structure, which involved a bigger, more powerful fan. After attaching the motor, however, the air was still not blowing upwards like we wanted, which we realized after consulting the teaching team was due to the fact that there is a solid 3D printed structure below the fan that does not allow for air to be gathered. We considered drilling holes through the 3D printed base, but then decided designing and reprinting our structure to allow more air flow would be more efficient and effective. We remodeled and began printing version 3 of the structure. <br> <span class="image fit"><img src="images/10_22_pic1.png" alt="" /></span>

									<li>10/24/2019 <br> During today’s meeting, we focused on finishing the sprint 1 presentation slides and discussed which medium we will be using for the final product. We decided to use Air as our medium since it can be done with better designs compared to water. By using air, we can use the money on more DC motors which means we can have more frequency channels. By choosing air, we realized that we have to discuss the team what can we put more into the electrical part since a lot of LED circuiting is temporarily removed from our todo list. <br> We received advice from the teaching team on how to make the mechanical component working, and from the feedback, we saw the possibility of our old mechanical structure functioning with little modification. We are trying to reprint some parts to test out whether they will work or not. <br> <span class="image fit"><img src="images/10_24_pic1.gif" alt="" /></span><br> -SeungU Lyu</li>

									<li>10/25/19 <br> Today, we presented what we accomplished in Sprint 1 to our peers and the teaching team. We were able to get very helpful feedback and new approaches to concepts from our peers and the teaching team. For the electrical and software sub-teams, realized that our initial plan of having two “modes” between the electrical and software parts were not really integration. We re-evaluated our ideas, and decided to keep our idea for the Fourier Transformed audio inputs for the frequencies of the songs while combining it with lights for the bass and beat of the songs. This combines both electrical and software beautifully while also making sure that we do not overscope for this project. The mechanical sub-team decided on a “leaf-blower” type fan design instead of a “computer fan” one. This newer design would help concentrate the air flow for us and make sure that the air goes directly into our frequency/visualizer channels. <br> -Audrey Lee</li>

									<li>10/27/19<br> Today, in the mechanical direction, we were working on shopping and ideation. We are wary about buying new materials, because of our limited budget, so plenty of research is necessary to determine whether certain motors are appropriate for our designs. In terms of software, today was highly efficient! Progress was made on debugging our Python to Arduino IDE. We also solved the problem of repeat authentication. Then, we went on to automate the identification of song BPM, and furthered our understanding of the structure of the song features (a dictionary, full of lists, some of which contain dictionaries).Today in the electrical team, we accidentally burnt out a few Op-Amps. We also finalized the rest of the circuit for getting the frequencies from our microphone component.<br> <span class="image fit"><img src="images/10_27_pic1.png" alt="" /></span><br>-Casey May </li>
									<li>10/29/19<br> <strong>Mechanical:</strong><br>We tested with a blower fan instead of the previous fan designs that had trouble pushing air through the triangular opening. When at the highest RPM, the blower fan design pushed a significant amount of air out. Thus, we discovered that the motor was even faster when directly connected to power instead of power and arduino (suggested by Professor Aaron). Aaron also suggested exploring with speakers or compressed air to prevent us from only struggling with fans throughout the entire final project.<br><strong>Electrical:</strong><br>Circuit is at a stance where can receive audio input, amplify the input, extract the peaks of the frequencies, and amplify that again. Is also debugging the program that does all the aforementioned functions.<br><strong>Software:</strong><br>For the data-processing side, we were able to sweep through the information per songs. However, we discovered that the sweeping takes too much time that by the time we get the information at a specific point of a song, it has moved onto a different point of a song. We also learned about a library called “Madmom” that takes about 5 seconds of processing and predicts music features with its neuralnet. For the serial communication, we realized that the Serial.isavailable() may not be responding instantly when a new input is given since it is in a while loop. Therefore, we are going to explore using Serial.interrupt().<br> -HK Rho</li>
									<li>10/31/19<br>During our ~spooky~ meeting today, we discussed logistics for what we want to accomplish in our next few meetings in order to meet the goals we set for Sprint 2. On the mechanical side, SeungU has designed a new blower fan that he plans to 3D print for tomorrow’s meeting. We have received the foam balls and mesh wire we had ordered. We are wondering about using actuators versus fan, which we are planning to test after fabricating a round acrylic tube during tomorrow’s meeting. We are trying to figure out what motor we are going to use, since we need a motor that can handle large amounts of current without melting. We are expecting that the motor will need to be controlled with PWM. The software team has been working on resolving git issues while merging their work. They have succeeded in getting serial communication working to control an LED! For electrical progress, we made a circuit schematic in KiCad (pictured below).<br><span class="image fit"><img src="images/10_31_pic1.jpg" alt="" /></span><br>-Julia Benton</li>
									<li>11/1/19<br> <strong>Mechanical:</strong><br>We created a better fan structure that can blow more air out compared to the last structure. We also worked on creating a circular cylinder, but we had to pivot and create a hex cylinder instead due to material issues. With the teaching team’s help, we were provided with a power supply that can measure the voltage and current, so now we can measure the current flowing to the motor with the load. <br> <span class="image fit"><img src="images/11_1_pic1.png" alt="" /></span><br> <strong>Electrical:</strong><br> The sensor is working now, being able to get input from the surrounding sound. We assumed that the sensor was not working, but hopefully, it was not the case.<br> <span class="image fit"><img src="images/11_1_pic2.png" alt="" /></span><span class="image fit"><img src="images/11_1_pic3.png" alt="" /></span><span class="image fit"><img src="images/11_1_pic4.jpg" alt="" /></span><br><strong>Software:</strong><br> Software: We succeeded in controlling the fan speed using the Adafruit motor shield. Also, we figured out how to solve an issue with Spotify API so we not can get whatever data we want from the song.<br>-SeungU Lyu</li>
									<li>11/3/19<br> 
										<strong>Electrical & Software:</strong><br>
										Today, the Electrical subteam integrated the sound waves captured with the microphone with the Software subteam to move the fan. We also worked on the Fast Fourier Transform code to capture the individual frequencies from the sound waves. We used an Arduino sample code for the Fast Fourier Transform. While we have not done anything yet with the information received from the Arduino, we now know how it will be formatted.

										<span class="image fit"><img src="images/11_3_pic2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										<span class="center">Fourier Transform graph of the sound waves’ individual frequencies.</span><br>
										The Software and Electrical team strived to get analog values from the microphone via the Arduino to control the fan speed. First, we successfully converted analog values from the Arduino to a Python script. Then depending if the value is above a certain value (500 for example), the Python script will send a value of 1 back to the Arduino Serial to test if the LED light on the light on the Arduino will turn on. The light would turn off if the analog value from the microphone was below the designated value. From this, we were able to control the speed of the fan with this concept.<br>The Electrical subteam also created a circuit for LED lights for the Software team to control. The Software subteam made advancements with visualizing the beat of the music with LED lights.

										<span class="center">The LED circuit for the Software subteam to utilize and control.</span><br>
										<br><strong>Mechanical:</strong><br>
										The Mechanical subteam designed and fabricated a hex cylinder pipe to test the structure. We made the base and the structure as well as put in the mesh to make sure that the foam balls do not escape. We also measured the current and discovered that the motor only drew approximately 0.3 Amperes maximum. This means that we can use lower current control, which will help us in the long run.

									<li>11/5/19<br> 
										<strong>Electrical:</strong><br>
										Today on the electrical team, we debugged the lighting board used to connect to Spotify to verify that the lights were correct, and ended up switching out the breadboard, and started working on sprint 2 presentation layout.
										<span class="image fit"><img src="images/11_5_pic1.jpg" alt="" /></span><br>
										<strong>Mechanical:</strong><br>
										Today we discussed the design of our structure, and decided we might pivot from a hexagonal tube to a square shape, which will be easier to raster stuff onto and be less money. We also started working on fixing the problem with static electricity. We considered pivoting from the Goblet of Fire design to a Hogwarts castle structure to incorporate the visualizer channels in a more aesthetic way.
										<br><br><strong>Software:</strong><br>
										Today the software team worked on calibrating the fan speeds with the height of the foam balls. Much of the work involved airflow manipulation. We also worked on serial communication from the Spotify code to the LEDs, but didn’t quite completely manage to make the LEDs respond actively, but in the end was able to turn them on from python.<br>-Casey May
									</li>
									<li>11/7/19<br>
										Today we all worked on the presentation for Sprint 2, and clarified questions amongst ourselves.
										<br><strong>Mechanical:</strong><br>
										The mechanical has worked on designing a final structure (not done yet) for the visualizer. We ordered eight RS-555 12V 6100RPM DC motors (we ordered a few extra in case some breaks). The mechanical team has also tried emptying the assembly to get rid of the static friction inside the acrylic.
										<span class="image fit"><img src="images/11_7_pic1.jpg" alt="" /></span><br>
										<strong>Electrical:</strong><br>
										Researched affordable LEDs suit for our visualizer. 
										<br><br><strong>Software:</strong><br>
										Tested the fan control before the demo tomorrow. We discovered two major problems: the microphone is not only sensitive to frequencies but also the air flow (e.g. wind we blow with our mouth), and although the fan usually reacts to the changes in the audio input it fails to react sometimes (even though the audio input goes over the bounds, the fans do not show changes). One assumption to this is the delay in transferring information between Arduino and Python. <br>-HK Rho
									</li>
									<li>11/8/19<br>
										Today, the team reported what we accomplished during Sprint 2 to our peers and the teaching team. We got helpful feedback on our current model and recommendations for moving forward from classmates and the teaching team. The team received feedback that we need to be very clear about what we want our demo day experience to look like. We got the recommendation of using a flow chart to clearly communicate whether preloaded Spotify data or live analog input is controlling the different features of our visualizer. The teaching team reminded us that Sprint 4 is extremely short and we must get very close to a final deliverable in Sprint 3. We also realized that we need to start making our team’s website and are considering using Jekyll through GitHub Pages. We started thinking about a cool raster design for the acrylic Hogwarts towers and began looking into ordering acrylic, LEDs, and marble 3D print filament.<br>-Julia Benton

We have the light respond actively to the song that is currently playing. In this meeting, we tried to figure out more about dictionaries in C and accessing the values in them. After discussing with Amon, we discovered what Serial communication and what the baud rate means. We realized that a higher baud rate means faster communication which may be fast enough to transfer data from the Arduino to Python.

                                        We collectively worked on looking at different themes for our website to choose the one that is simplistic, aesthetic, and easy to navigate. The mechanical team will 3D print the fans to make sure there if there are any more modifications that needs to be made in the CAD. The software team has continued working on extracting the maximum amplitudes of six frequency ranges to control the motors. <br>-HK Rho

                                        Today in the software team we made progress in a pivoted direction for how to scrape the majority of our information for the lighting, using PulseAudio. We also made progress on getting the frequencies divided into six channels. There are some formatting issues we’re running into in terms of frequency samples.<br>
                                        In the mechanical team we spent a long time trying to get a 3D print that was stuck off the printer. We’re focusing on the aesthetics of the castle  and planning on trying to get some free filament by writing a review on the filament site.<br>
                                        In the electrical team there was a bit of a lapse because of waiting on parts, so most of the progress made was on initial website work, because that deadline is coming up fast.<br>-Casey May

                                        During today’s meeting, the team continued working hard to achieve our MVP with the knowledge that our Sprint 3 review is in just five days. The software team tackled two challenges, one of which is that when sending data from Arduino to Python, a null value appears while decoding the data that introduces us to an index error. This results in breaking out of the loops and making the program think there is a problem. Many members of the team worked together in trying to solve this problem. The other area that the software team made progress in is moving information from Spotify through serial delay into a new database to preprocess information for lighting without delay during visualization.<br>

                                        The mechanical team continued doing lots of CAD and moved forward in the manufacturing process by 3D printing with the marble colored filament that we purchased. We are planning to cut and raster the acrylic towers during Tuesday’s meeting. We redesigned the blower fan and are troubleshooting mechanical problems as they arise, one of which is the sheer amount of time that our numerous 3D prints are going to take.<br>

                                        There is still not much electrical work to be done at this point, so the focus has shifted to website design. We decided on a Jekyll theme and to use html rather than JavaScript.<br>-Julia Benton

                                        11/21/19 & 11/22/19<br>
                                        On the 21st, we decided to schedule an extra meeting to ensure that we would be able to integrate our parts correctly. The electrical subteam was able to put in the lights into the tower that the mechanical subteam manufactured, and the software team was able to control the lights and the fan speed. We discovered that the lights can be programmed to do a variety of colors and patterns. However, depending on the brightness, lower wavelengths of light may not show up. We discovered that unless the NeoPixels were at full brightness, the color red would not show up. After this discovery and putting everything together, we turned off all the lights and admired our creation.

                                        <span class="center">The whole team is admiring our work.</span><br>
                                        On the 22nd, we still worked on perfecting the NeoPixel blinking tempo and fan speed for the Software subteam as well as finishing up the second tower for the Mechanical subteam. The Electrical subteam helped both subteams with the lights, fan, and tower assembly. We now have two towers with lights and the fan speed can be controlled.

                                        Today in the mechanical team, it was down to the nitty gritty assembly of our final product. With deadlines approaching, the mechanical team has 3 more towers to assemble and some foreground structures to put together. We’re slightly short on materials so we’ll have to do some scavenging.<br>

                                        In the electrical team, today was focused on getting the electrical parts of the final three lights together. We also started working on the website!<br>

                                        In the software team, today was time to work on ironing out the foam ball visualization levels and website work! We still have some stuff to figure out with the foam balls, because there’s a lot of noise.<br>-Casey May

                                    Today’s meeting was our final instructional period before demo day on Wednesday! The POE teaching team checked in with us to discuss our progress and their expectations for the five minute rocket talk we will give to classmates and guests. Our team feels that we are on track to deliver a product that we are proud of in addition to an aesthetic, informational website. In our last class period, the electrical team made progress in developing our website and creating the circuit PCB, shown in the picture below. The PCB is a replacement for the breadboard circuit and is cleaner, smaller, and should work better.
                                    <span class="image fit"><img src="images/12_6_19_pic1.png" alt="" /></span>

                                    The mechanical subteam cleaned the support off our 3D prints and acquired several screws from the Weissman Foundry, the open-door design studio that can be used by Babson, Olin, and Wellesley students and is a short walk from our Olin classroom. They were able to assemble the remaining two towers and are still 3D printing a few more castle pieces.

                                    The software team worked on editing the light code to work for all five lights. They also researched AUX output control, debugged the code that controls the channels, and ordered soundproofing foam eggcrate tiles so we can better test our microphone.

                                    Software team focused on controlling the LED, since a new issue popped up with using the spotify API. We worked on fixing it, and we were able to figure out the reason why and manage to fix the problem.

                                    Also, we decided to use extra motor shield for the motors, so we worked on attaching extra motor shield to the arduino so that the motors do not use too much current for single motor shield (2A limit) and because there is only room for four motors per shield.

                                    For Mechanical team, we focused on creating remaining parts of the structure (roof for the building) so that the mechanical part is 100% done.

                                        Today was a very eventful day as it was the day before demo day. Under a lot of pressure to make everything look presentable, we also encountered a lot of problems. The first thing we did was work on the rocket pitch slides for demo day. This was straightforward and were able to get them done. Our next step was to hook up all of the motors to the motor shields and control them with audio input. When hooking up the motors to the motor shields, we noticed that something was amiss. The green light on the top motor shield was flickering, so we unplugged it for a bit, and then plugged it back in. We thought it was alright since the green light stayed constantly on, but then we saw smoke and smelled something burning. We immediately unplugged the power supply and looked at the motor shields. One of the h-bridge chips was completely melted and fried. The smoke from this chip charred a bit of the motor shield on top. While we believe that the top motor shield did not sustain any damage, the bottom one most certainly did.

                                        <span class="center">Top motor shield is the one that we believe is still functional. The bottom motor shield sustained damage to the h-bridge chip.</span><br>
                                        Before we even plugged in our motors, we calculated and tested to make sure that the motors did not draw too much current. They seemed fine when we tested them, but unfortunately we burned out a chip and we learned from this experience. In order to solve this problem, and make sure that we do not burn out any more motor shields, we decided to stack five motor shields on top of each with each one containing a single motor as to ensure that they would not draw too much current. This proved to be effective and we were able to control the motors effectively (although we still try and keep an eye on the motor shields just in case).<br />
                                        The next problem we encountered was with printing/sending data from the Arduino to Python to see the motor speeds change as a result of the audio input. Before we put in all five motors and only had two, this part of the code worked well. However, when we changed our setup, this code did not work as well, and one of the channels would not work properly. We deleted the line that prints the motor speeds, so we cannot see the motor speeds, but now the channels work.<br />
                                        Through the hardships, we were able to stick together as a team and persevere. We were able to get a video of our finished product and a team photo to commemorate our progress! <br />

                                    We developed and prototyped a system which is capable of visualizing analog sound input. We started with prototyping a sound receiver on a breadboard. We worked towards a functional PCB, that would receive sound input, filter, amplify it. This amplified signal would then be sent to be processed by the <a href="#software">Software</a> and Electrical Subsystems by applying Fourier Transform to extract the frequencies from the signal. With these extracted frequencies, we would be able to control the fan speeds to visualize the frequencies in our channels built by the <a href="#mechanical">Mechanical</a> Subsystem.

                                    We also developed the light system that would be utilized to visualize the beat of the song. This relied on the <a href="#software">Software</a> Subsystem’s algorithm to get the rhythm of the song.

                                    We first started off with a circuit that could just detect sound waves. It worked like it was supposed to, but it was hard to see if there were any discernible sounds caused by the team.

                                    <span class="image fit"><img src="images/10_22_pic1.png" alt="" /></span>
                                    <br />
                                    Next, we moved on to amplifying the signal so we could see noticeable differences in pitch changes. We plugged the circuit into a breadboard that contains  the microphone and preamplifier. As an added measure, we also wanted to include a peak detector and a buffer amplifier. The schematic of the circuit can be seen in the schematic section of this page. The picture below is the breadboard circuit of the <a href="#schematic">schematic</a>.

                                    <br />
                                    After we found that our breadboard circuit worked, we moved on to designing a PCB on KiCad. We converted the KiCad schematic to a KiCad PCB format to get Gerber files, and ordered it from OSHPark:
                                    <br />
                                    <span class="image fit"><img src="images/11_12_pic1.png" alt="" /></span>
                                    <span class="image fit"><img src="images/11_12_pic2.png" alt="" /></span>
                                    <br />
                                    When we received our PCB two weeks later, we unfortunately found out that the op-amp we had in stock was too big for the surface-mount pads on our PCB. This was because we accidentally put an LMV324 as our op-amp instead of an OPA4353UA op-amp.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    Since we could not use our PCB, we decided to make the circuit neater by using a proto board.
                                    <br />
                                    <span class="image fit"><img src="images/12_6_19_pic1.png" alt="" /></span>
                                    <br />
                                    We decided that we only needed the first half of the circuit since that was all that was needed for processing the signal.

								<h3 class="major" id="motor">Motor Control</h3>
								<p> The software system for controlling the motors beneath each of the five towers was dependent on the analog audio input from a microphone.
									The output from the microphone was a single frequency that was a combination of all the existing frequencies of a given sound input.
									To break down the output into different frequencies and their respective amplitudes, fast fourier transform (FFT) was applied to the output.
									Then we extracted the frequencies with the highest amplitudes and used the amplitudes to control the speed of the motors.
								</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/motor_control_flowchart.jpg" alt="" /></span>

								<h3 class="h3.subsection">Serial Communication Between Arduino and Python Script</h4>
								<p>
									The software subteam first started by sending and receiving data between the Arduino and the Python script through serial communication.
									We decided to send data from the Arduino and then process the data in the Python script rather than sending and processing the data all in the Arduino.
									This decision was made based on the difficulty of data wrangling and processing in C++. 
								</p>

								<h3 class="h3.subsection">Selection of the Highest Amplitudes</h4>
								<p>
									Once the data from each timestamp was delivered to the Python script, we processed the data so that the five highest amplitudes would be selected from 
									each timestamp, and those amplitudes would be sent back to the Arduino for controlling the motor speeds.
									The amplitudes were scaled up to show more visible changes in the motor speeds. <br>
									One of the challenges we had to deal in this process was involved dealing with empty data.
									When empty data was detected, we moved onto reading the next line of the data to prevent errors. 
								</p>

								<h3 class="h3.subsection">Controlling the Motors with Multiple Motor Shields</h4>
								<p>
									After the Arduino receives the five highest amplitudes, the amplitudes are used to control the motors.
									We used five different motorshields respective to each motor to prevent possible burning of the motor shields.
									A big difficulty we faced when visualizing music from the microphone was struggling to synch the height of the foam balls with the audio input.
									It was very difficult to detect sounds resulting from clapping, singing, whistling, etc. due to the noise in the background, which included the sound of the running motors.
									As a fix to this, we made a soundproof box and placed the microphone within it along with speakers.
